        <p>My world revolves around my family. Like most parents, I think the world of my kids. They’re simply awesome. My wife is my strength and my confidant. She’s also an incredible cook.</p>

        <p>Squash is my most favorite sport to play but I’ll also play a mean game of table tennis and badminton. I like basketball, target shooting, mountain biking, and I’ll watch football if I happen upon it on TV. You could say I’m athletic, I have a competitive streak, I love winning, and that I’m a regular guy. I love grilling food and enjoying it with friends, good beer, and quick wit. I like having my morning espresso to start the day. I like fast cars, planes, and motorcycles.</p>

        <p>As a kid, I grew up watching my dad work and tagging along to his meetings. He was an ad exec working as SVP for McCann-Erickson, and a creative genius. Skateboarding around the city, his office was a convenient place for me to hangout. I love fast-paced environments. I have an innate curiosity and high cognitive ability. I’ll learn the skills I need, and find ways to improve upon it. Entrepreneurial by nature, I always see the big picture.</p>

        <p>I had a lot of fun in college, although I got serious when it came to quantitative analysis and calculus. I just love that stuff. Having a bit of marketing DNA, I was in my element with subjects related to marketing strategy. While in college, I started working for the family business. Then I worked with my dad at a PR firm he founded. I became a single father early, but that didn’t stop me. I co-founded a bar and music lounge where bands played live music. It was the hottest spot in town during it’s time. It still exists today.</p>

        <p>I later co-founded a discount/gift card company that garnered 5,000 users in 3 weeks, and that evolved into a cooperative of 30,000 people providing outsourced manufacturing services to companies.</p>

        <p>I know I’ve got grit, because when I got married and moved to the U.S., I went into car sales, group health insurance sales (B2B), and mortgage lending. In each, I was “thrown into the pit” to start producing on my own even if I was as green as a pea. I succeeded in all roles. I wrote my own sales scripts and utilized a proprietary streamlined approach to processing sales, always with customer satisfaction as priority.</p>

        <p>Striking out on my own again, I found excitement for code, analytics, design, and web development while doing affiliate work for performance ad networks like Clickbooth, NeverBlue, MaxBounty, and others. The same is true, when I pivoted into full stack marketing for small businesses. I basically increase their sales. I build, launch, and run their websites, create and manage their email marketing, lead generation, social media presence, and execute marketing strategies that convert while coming in under budget. I am a Full Stack Marketer (don’t let the title kid you– I do a lot of pro bono work). Yet without formal training, I’d get into website code to fix design, squash bugs, and improve UX for the site to achieve business goals. A Product Designer of sorts. While still doing this, I designed and developed a game for iOS, managing a team of outsourced developers. I have taken an initiative to gain a deeper understanding of code through Codecademy and Code School. I certainly don’t consider myself to be a full stack web developer… yet, but I’m resourceful, creative, and want to get better at it. So I have committed to becoming a cohort at The Iron Yard this autumn, right here in Charleston, SC. It will be awesome.</p>

        <p>I am adept at interfacing with all types of people, I collaborate well with others, and I’ve always made lasting friendships wherever I worked. I’m an amateur fan of startups and the VC/investing world.</p>

        <p>I like most people I meet, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>If you like my background image, it's from my visit to Portofino, Italy last summer. This is one of my favorite photos, and it reminds me of the deliciously ecstatic Frutti di Mare I had with Rosé at Delfino, the shoreside restaurant.</p>
